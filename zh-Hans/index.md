## Welcome to learnlatex.org (Chinese)!

This site aims to help you take the first steps with LaTeX, a document
preparation system designed to produce high-quality typeset output. LaTeX can
be scary for new users as it is _not_ a word processor, and because it is not a
single program. Our aim here is to help you get started without trying to show
you _everything_ in one go.

know, and made them into short 'lessons'. Each lesson is very focused, so they
should not take too long to cover. In each lesson, we've given examples of what
you'd write, and they are available so you can try them out online.

lessons. To help guide you when you need more information, we have therefore
included a 'going further' page for each lesson. This extra information is
there to support you when you need the detail, but should not get in your
way if you do not.

## How the examples work

To support your learning, the site includes lots of examples. In

<<<<<<< HEAD
[Lesson 2](lesson-02) we will talk about how you use LaTeX both online and
with a local installation on your PC. To get you started, we have set up
our examples so you can edit and run them in this website. We
have also linked them to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), one of the
most popular online LaTeX editing services. But don't worry, you can also
use the examples on your machine. You can read more about how to use the
examples in [the help page](help).

Our examples are based around using an up-to-date LaTeX installation. They
all work with both of our online demonstration systems, so if you get
errors with the examples we provide, you might want to check if your LaTeX
system is up-to-date.

## Going further

The focused lessons here are not meant to cover everything you'll ever need to
know about LaTeX; we want to give you enough to get started and to _understand_
examples and advice elsewhere. We cover getting more information in [the last
lesson](lesson-16), but it's worth saying now that getting access to a book

Finally we offer a gallery of small examples showing
a range of different subject areas not covered in this introduction,
and different LaTeX packages in those areas.
