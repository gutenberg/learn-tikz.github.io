## Learn LaTeX

**Take your first steps with LaTeX, a document preparation system designed to produce high-quality typeset output.**

<div

  <section>
    <h3 
      class="text-columns__heading">Introduction</h3>
    <p>LaTeX can be scary for new users as it is <em>not</em> a word processor, 
    and because it is not a single program. Our aim here is to help you get 
    started with LaTeX from the basics, installation, to writing code, without 
    trying to show you <em>everything</em> in one go.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3
      class="text-columns__heading">How it works</h3>
    We have taken around 16 of the most important things you will need to know, 
    and made them into short <em>lessons</em> which should not take long to cover. 
    In each lesson, we give lots of examples of what you would write. You can edit 
    and run them in this website.

## The lessons

{% include toc-lessons.html  prefix="en/lesson" %}

<div
  class="text-columns">
  <section>
    <h3 
      class="text-columns__heading">How the examples work</h3>
      <p>We have also linked them to <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, one of the most popular online LaTeX editing services. But don't worry, you can also use the examples on your machine. You can read more about how to use the examples in <a href="./help">the help page</a>.</p>
      <p>Our examples are based around using an up-to-date LaTeX installation. They all work with both of our online demonstration systems, so if you get errors with the examples we provide, you might want to check if your LaTeX system is up-to-date.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3
      class="text-columns__heading">Going further</h3>
      <p>The focused lessons here are not meant to cover everything you will ever need to know about LaTeX; we want to give you enough to get started and to <em>understand</em> examples and advice elsewhere. We cover getting more information in <a href="./lesson-16">the last lesson</a>, but it is worth saying now that getting access to a book about LaTeX is still the  best way to learn the details. We give some recommendations in the last lesson.</p>
      <p>Finally we offer a gallery of small examples showing a range of different subject areas not covered in this introduction, and different LaTeX packages in those areas.</p>

### Additional lessons specific to learnlatex.org/en

<h3>How it works</h3>
We know that people will want to know more than we can cover in 16 short
lessons. To help guide you when you need more information, we have therefore
included a 'going further' page for each lesson. This extra information is
there to support you when you need the detail, but should not get in your
way if you do not.
