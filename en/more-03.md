## Running LaTeX

As [detailed earlier](lesson-02), LaTeX documents are simply plain text. To see
this, try opening your first document in a simple text editor, for example
on Windows using Notepad. You should see the same text as in a dedicated LaTeX
editor, but without any highlight of keywords.

You can also convert to PDF without your editor; this means using the Command
Prompt/Terminal, so don't worry if you are not familiar with this. If you
*are*, you can navigate to the directory containing your `.tex` source file and
run

`pdflatex first`

or

`pdflatex first.tex`

to typeset your PDF. Notice that the `.tex` extension is optional: LaTeX will
assume files end with`.tex` unless you specify otherwise.

## Special characters

If you need to type in a special character, most of the time you can simply
use a backslash in front of it, so for example `\{` is used to print a literal
`{`. There are a few cases where you need a command instead

| Symbol | Command           |
| `{`    | `\{`              |
| `}`    | `\}`              |
| `$`    | `\$`              |
| `%`    | `\%`              |
| `&`    | `\&`              |
| `~`    | `\textasciitilde` |
| ``\``  | `\textbackslash`  |
