title: Selecting fonts and using Unicode engines

XeLaTeX example

\usepackage{fontspec}

Before Unicode, LaTeX provided support for many types of *file encoding* that
allowed text to be written in various languages natively — for example, using
the `latin1` encoding French users could write ‘`déjà vu`’ and LaTeX would
internally translate the accented letters into TeX commands to produce the
correct output.

This approach is still in use in modern LaTeX when using the `pdflatex` engine.
By default all files are assumed to be Unicode (UTF-8 encoded) unless otherwise
specified. Although this engine is limited to 8-bit fonts, most European
languages can be supported.

Font selection with `pdflatex` uses the robust LaTeX font selection scheme, and
nowadays there are many fonts ready-to-use in a standard LaTeX distribution. For
example, the TeX Gyre fonts are a suite of high-quality fonts based on common
fonts that most people are familiar with such as Times, Helvetica, Palatino, and
others. To load these fonts, it is as simple as loading a package with the
appropriate name. For a Times lookalike, the TeX Gyre name is Termes:

```latex
\usepackage{tgtermes}
```
{: .noedit :}

For `pdflatex`, most fonts are accessible through packages.  You can have a look
at [The LaTeX Font Catalogue](https://www.tug.org/FontCatalogue/) or the
[CTAN page on the ‘Font’ topic](https://www.ctan.org/topic/font) to see some
options.  You can also search on the Internet for the font you want, and look
for a `pdflatex`-compatible package version.  If you want to use a proprietary
font, you can search for a suitable clone, which for most applications is
similar enough to the original.

LuaLaTeX example

This selects the TeX Gyre Termes font, as in the `pdflatex` example above. Notably, this approach works for *any* OpenType font.
Having selected a font, input can now be typed directly in plain Unicode into a source document.
Here is an example showing some Latin and Greek letters as well as some CJK ideographs:

This selects the TeX Gyre Termes font, as in the `pdflatex` example above.
Notably, this approach works for *any* OpenType font.  Some fonts available for
`pdflatex` are also available to `xelatex` and `lualatex` through their
respective packages as well, or by loading any font you have installed on your
computer by using `fontspec` as shown above.
[The LaTeX Font Catalogue](https://www.tug.org/FontCatalogue/) also shows fonts
with OpenType formats available, so you can use that as a resource for looking
up fonts, as well as the [CTAN page](https://www.ctan.org/topic/font) mentioned
earlier.

When switching between languages it is usually important to also
change things like hyphenation patterns and so on, and the `babel` and
`polyglossia` packages both provide robust features to do this.
