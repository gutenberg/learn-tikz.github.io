# learnlatex.org

## Overview

This repository provides the source for learnlatex.org, a site aimed at
providing a basic introduction to LaTeX. To make the material accessible, it is
broken down into a series of small lessons. The demonstration files provided
are also hosted on-line to let new users get started straight away.

The LaTeX ecosystem is rich and complex, and this can be intimidating to new
users. To avoid overload, this site therefore is quite deliberately limited in
scope, covering essential ideas using core LaTeX packages and classes, and
leaving further help to other places.

### Contributing

The learnlatex.org site is run by a small team of volunteers, with the [LaTeX
Project](https://www.latex-project.org) taking the lead. We are very happy to
take contributions, provided they fall within the 'beginners' scope. We know
there are _lots_ of things we do not cover, but we've tried to agree a core
curriculum that delivers for everyone.

## Design

[@jonasjacek](https://github.com/jonasjacek) is currently working on design (visual preasentation) and webmaster tasks.

Jonas regularly merges the `master` branch into the `design` branch to develop as close as possible to the content community work.

The `design` branch is currently [published on Netlify](https://learnlatex.netlify.app/).

What you see there is not the final result. It is a work status that can change radically at any time. Feel free to send in [suggestions and issues](https://github.com/learnlatex/learnlatex.github.io/issues).
